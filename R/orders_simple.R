ORDERS_SIMPLE_SYNTHETIC_TYPE <- "simple"

#' One plain order sent to one broker, with nothing watching it afterwards
#'
#' @description
#' This is what UBI's order engine runs when an order carries no `synthetic` object at all, unless the order is a plain limit or market order that UBI holds or follows the book with. Asking for it by name is useful for four things: to send a `limit` order to the broker at once, since a plain limit order with a price is otherwise held inside UBI as a `virtual_limit` until the other side reaches its price; to send a real `market` order, since a plain market order is otherwise run as a `marketable_limit` that follows the other side of the book for 30 seconds and is refused with HTTP 409 when that side is empty; to mark the order as closing a position with `closes_position`, so it may use the share of a broker's daily order cap kept for exits; and to make it reduce-only with `reduce_only`.
#'
#' The order template's attributes are described on `SyntheticOrder`, and this type adds none of its own.

    #' Initialises the order template and this type's own settings.
    #' @param instrument The `TradeableInstrument` to place the order in.
    #' @param transaction_type The character side of the order, `"buy"` or `"sell"`.
    #' @param product The character product, `"cnc"` for delivery, `"mis"` for intraday or `"nrml"` for carry forward.
    #' @param order_type The character kind of order, `"market"`, `"limit"`, `"sl"` or `"sl-m"`.
    #' @param quantity The integer quantity in underlying units, not lots, or `NULL` when a quantity reference supplies it.
    #' @param price The numeric limit price in rupees, or `NULL` for an order type that takes no price or when a price reference supplies it.
    #' @param trigger_price The numeric trigger price in rupees of the order itself, or `NULL` for an order type that takes no trigger.
    #' @param validity The character validity, `"day"` or `"ioc"`, or `NULL` to let UBI use `"day"`.
    #' @param disclosed_quantity The integer quantity to show on the exchange, or `NULL` to disclose the whole order.
    #' @param after_market A logical that is `TRUE` to send the order as an after-market order.
    #' @param tag A character label of up to twenty letters and digits to label the order with, or `NULL`.
    #' @param price_reference A named list describing the price for UBI to work out, such as `list(kind = "mid")`, or `NULL`.
    #' @param quantity_reference A named list describing the quantity for UBI to work out, such as `list(kind = "liquidate_position")`, or `NULL`.
    #' @param closes_position A logical that is `TRUE` when every order this type sends closes a position, so it may use the share of a broker's daily order cap kept for exits.
    #' @param reduce_only A logical that is `TRUE` to have UBI refuse, with HTTP 409, any leg that is not on the closing side of the net position held when it is sent or is bigger than that position.
    #' @param hold_limits A logical that is `TRUE` to have UBI hold each order that would rest at the broker at a fixed limit price until the other side of the book reaches it, `FALSE` to send them as they come, or `NULL` to let UBI use the type's default.
    #' @param dry_run A logical that is `TRUE` to have UBI build the first broker request and return it without recording or sending anything.
    #' @return A new `SimpleOrder` object.
